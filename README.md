# Exploring-NOAA-storm-database

## Synopsis

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Data

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.


## Questions
Your data analysis must address the following questions:

1- Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the \color{red}{\verb|EVTYPE|}EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.


## Requirements
For this assignment you will need some specific tools

1- RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.

2- knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML
